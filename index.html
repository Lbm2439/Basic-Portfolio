          <p>
            After alot of years wondering around this planet confused, I think I found 
            something I really enjoy, Coding!  It all started on a bored summer day in 
            San Diego, California.  I found myself drinking wine and building puzzles.  
            I became so addicted to puzzles, it almost ruined my social life.  Kidding, 
            point is, I was THAT bored!  I had a degree in Graphic Deisgn and Photography
            that I used, but only when jobs became availabe.  That field of work was becoming
            so saturated and jobs were highly competitive and people no longer wanted to 
            pay for services and believe it or not, San Diego is outrageously expensive, and
            it looked like, I was going to need a few million to get by.  Kidding, again.  I 
            decided to create a side hustle to make extra cash and make work not feel so much
            like work.  I opened a business, clothing to be exact.  I created every piece of
            advertising graphic, logo, website, etc, all alone in my living room.  With the
            help of a large amount of coffee and Adobe Creative Suite, my empire grew!  I 
            think somewhere around this point I saw myself doing more web design.  Upon moving
            back home to Richmond, a friend asked if I knew how to code, because they were hiring
            and figured I would be good at it.  A month later, I was inrolled at The University 
            Of Richmond and loved everysecond of my new found "puzzles".
